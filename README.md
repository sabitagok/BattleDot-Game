# BattleDot-Game
This is a BattleDot, an unpopular networked spinoff of the popular Battleship game. Rather than having two players oppose each other directly, any player will be attacked by one opponent and in turn will attack a different opponent.     Players are connected in a ring: A is bombing B who is bombing C, ... who is bombing Z who is bombing A.     Each player has a 10x10 grid of "dots" where one "single-dot ship" is positioned randomly. A player loses if this ship is bombed.     Players cannot see each other's grids directly. Each player randomly selects a dot location on the enemy grid to bomb, and sends the bomb to the enemy. If the bomb lands in the enemy's dot-ship, the enemy dies; otherwise, it lives. When a player dies, relevant neighbors are matched up so that their unfinished games can continue.     For example: A is bombing B is bombing C is bombing D is bombing A. If B hits C's ship, B wins, C loses/dies. B is now bombing D.
